# Tasks

Four sections, and they hand work back and forth.

**1. Needs you** is everything blocked on you: a migration to run, a credential
to supply, a decision to make, a question to answer. Nothing here moves until
you touch it, so it goes first.

**2. Open** is my list. Things to build or fix, none of them waiting on you.

**3. For you to review** is the softer half of your list: things built and
working that I cannot confirm on my own, because they need an eye or a phone.
Looking at them is the whole job.

**4. Done and verified** is the record, with the evidence for each line.

The difference between 1 and 3 is whether anything is blocked. A migration that
has not run means a column is missing and a chart is empty; an unreviewed
design means nothing at all until you dislike it. Section 1 used to hold only
my questions, which is why three migrations sat in section 3 where they read
as optional. They were not.

**A status is a claim and needs evidence.** Section 4 names the check, the
browser run or your own word. Nothing sits in section 3 that a check could
have proved instead.

---

## 1. Needs you

Everything here is blocked on something only you can do. A migration I am
not allowed to run, a credential I do not have, a decision that is yours.
Nothing in here is waiting on me.

Ids never change, so R28 stays R28 wherever it sits. Tell me "R28 run" or
"O5 leave it" and I move it on.

### Run these in the SQL editor

I deliver migrations and you run them. That is deliberate and it is in
CLAUDE.md, so anything new sits here until you do.

**Nothing waiting.** 061 to 071 are all run.

| # | Migration |
|--|--|

### Decide these

| # | Decision |
|--|--|
| O7 | **Nothing to do unless you want to change it. Answer when you have a view.** Every page has a hidden tag telling Google which address is the real one, and all thirty-odd of them say `attune-relationships.com` while the site actually serves from `www.attune-relationships.com`. Google follows the redirect, so nothing is broken today. Changing them is a small SEO risk either way, which is why I have not done it on my own: search rankings attach to one address, and moving the tags moves which one. My recommendation is to leave it until closer to launch and then change them all at once. |
| O1 | **No action needed until the app is in the App Store.** When it is, tell me and I change two lines: `APP_LIVE = true` and the store link. That turns on the download buttons and the app mentions across the site, all of which read from those two lines. |
| O16 | **No action needed until the app is in the App Store.** Right, as you say. When it is live, download numbers need an App Store Connect API key, an issuer id and a private key from your Apple developer account, and I will tell you exactly where to click. Two things on the Engagement page are waiting on it and both say so on the page. |

### Answer these

**Nothing waiting.** Q10 is answered: the workbook opens as a converted web
version inside the app.

| # | Question |
|--|--|

## 2. Open

My list. Things to build or fix, none of them waiting on you.

When you send me a list, or when a sweep turns something up, it appears here.

| # | Task |
|--|--|
| O208 | **A table rather than buttons, if you still want one.** You: "I want expectations exercise in the app to have a table like the site mobile experience. Not a million pill shaped buttons." The pills went yesterday: the app draws the site's cards now, with four fixed columns that line up down the page. Look at it before I build a third version, and if you still want the column headings across the top, say so and it is an afternoon. |
| O201 | **The intimacy framing should be a question the couple answers, not a column on the profile.** Your description of how it used to work is how the website still works: it asks one framing question, the first partner answers it, and it locks for both. The app reads relationship_status instead, which is a different rule for the same decision and is why a couple could be asked one way on one surface and the other way on the other. Make the app use the couple's own answer, the way the site does. |
| O199 | **The completion pages.** Both surfaces, all five exercises. |
| O186 | **The completion page matches the site.** The site says "Exercise 2 Complete." with an eyebrow under it and a line about what is next; the app says the exercise's name and a waiting line. Both surfaces get one version, and the hero is already yours. |

## 3. For you to review

Things that are built, shipped and working, that I cannot confirm on my own.
Design and copy need your eye; the rest needs a phone.

Nothing that a check can prove is in here. Those live in section 4 with the
name of the check that proves them.

**Ids are stable.** Tell me "R7 verified" or "R7, no, the glow is still too
subtle" and I move it to section 4 or open it in section 2. They are not in
any order; work through them however suits.

### Design, and whether it looks right

| # | Review |
|--|--|
| R162 | **The workbook opens as a page in the app.** Not a second version of it: the page converts the document that was actually generated, so a change to the workbook shows up here with nothing to update and there is never a web version saying something different. It carries our type and colours; the parts of the Word layout that were tables are tables that scroll sideways rather than squeeze. Two things to judge: whether the reading holds up, and whether you want the .docx still reachable from somewhere for printing and email. |
| R163 | **Expects or Experienced, by a switch above the table** rather than four columns. Each answer gets twice the room, and the comparison stays between the two of you. Categories that never asked the growing-up question have no switch. |
| R164 | **The finding and the mark are centred in the gap**, whatever the tile below is holding. They were centred in that space already but carried a bottom padding, which pushed them up by half of it. |
| R2 | **App insights and results.** Every section the website has, drawn the same way: couple type and its map, the storycards, comms, expectations, reflection, intimacy, conflict. 28 sections now: the reflection action plan and Conversations Worth Having were both removed from both surfaces. |

### Copy, and whether the words are yours

| # | Review |
|--|--|
| R10 | **Privacy policy.** Everything in it, including the paragraph I wrote about the engagement measurements. |
| R11 | **Terms of service.** |
| R12 | **The effective dates on both**, which still read "TODO before publishing". Only you can set them. |

### Behaviour, which has to be used rather than looked at

You asked whether these have to wait for the App Store. Almost none of them
do. Each one now opens with what it needs, so you can tell at a glance
whether it is something you can do this afternoon in the simulator.

The simulator is a real copy of the app: taps, drags, text selection and the
keyboard all work, with the mouse standing in for a finger. What it cannot do
is be a phone that has been closed for a day, or have a real Apple ID, or
receive a notification from Apple's servers.

| # | Review |
|--|--|
| R112 | **Opening a mark lands on the line.** Every results page now shares one scroll view, and the paragraph holding the marked words asks it to scroll there once, after layout, with a little headroom above. I have not been able to drive this end to end myself: it needs a mark on a results section and a tap, and my synthetic taps have been landing in the wrong place all week. Worth a try from the Notes tab on a results mark. |
| R113 | **The table's columns line up.** They were three flex children in the header and three more in each row, and flex divides what is left after each child's content is measured: a blank header cell and a cell holding "01 Relationship Reflection" do not measure the same, so the two rows divided the width differently. Fixed percentages from one place now. |
| R114 | **The sign-in screen no longer flashes on a tab you have not visited.** All four tabs load when the app starts, so a tab that loaded while signed out was holding a sign-in screen. It did reload when you opened it, and said nothing while it did, so a session that was fine looked like one that had ended. It shows the spinner now. |
| R115 | **The exercises: A and B side by side, Back at the left and Next at the right, both with arrows, and the controls in the same place on every question.** The question block and the option row each have a floor under them, so a one-line question and a three-line one put the scale in the same spot. |
| R105 | **The margin marker was drawn outside the paragraph.** Fine on an article, invisible on a results page, where most prose sits in a tile with rounded corners that clips whatever hangs outside it. The paragraph gives up eighteen points of width for it now, so it cannot be clipped by anything. |
| R106 | **The note screen is gone.** Adding a note is a popup: the box, the share toggle, and a way to add a tag. The title field went with the screen. It was optional, almost nobody filled it in, and the list already leads with the first line of a note that has none. An existing note keeps its title rather than losing it on an unrelated edit. |
| R107 | **The selection is one block**, straight above and below, not a rounded box per word. |
| R108 | **The top of an In Practice article can be marked**: the title, the standfirst and every heading. Only the body could be, which is to say the one sentence a piece opens with was the one sentence you could not keep. |
| R109 | **The workbook builds when you ask for it.** Building it when results unlock does nothing for a couple whose results opened months ago, which is every couple that exists today. Tapping a workbook that is not there now asks for one and hands it over when it lands, a few seconds later. Also: an invitee could never find the file at all, because the lookup only ever asked for orders in their own name and the order belongs to the buyer. |
| R20 | **A real device, and time.** Sign in, close the app, come back tomorrow. The simulator can do the first two; the point of this one is the third, and a simulator that has been asleep is not a phone that has been in a bag overnight. |

### Verified in code rather than by eye

Everything below was in the old "done, not verified" list and is provable
without you looking at anything. The check that proves each one runs on every
build.

| Verified | By |
|--|--|
| What Comes Next collects the same six sections on both surfaces | the server had five and not the same five: Conflict but no Communication, while the website had Communication and no Conflict. `check-what-comes-next.mjs`, planted |
| The payload carries nothing either surface leaves undrawn | protocols and widest were the last two; both are consumed where they are used now, and `check-app-draws-payload.mjs` has an empty exemption list |
| The six values neither surface drew are no longer computed or sent | gone from the payload, the app's types and the one test that asserted on one |
| A storycard is the same size on a laptop, a phone and in the download | the text sizes against the card rather than the browser window; 16 of 135 nodes moved, all of them to the size the app already used |
| The app draws the action plan note the site shows | `tile.reflect` arrived on the payload and nothing drew it; `check-app-draws-payload.mjs` now fails on any results field the app never names, planted three ways |
| Both people's placement dots are visible when they gave the same rating | the app drew them at the same point at the same size, so the second covered the first; `check-overlapping-marks.mjs`, planted twice |
| The phone's pill nav offers every section the sidebar does | it had five of eight and no Conflict Patterns at all; rendered at 420px it now shows Type & Map, Comms, Expectations, Refl., Intimacy, Conflict, What's Next. `check-mobile-nav.mjs` |
| Phrases to try is three shaded tiles with a phrase in each, on both | rendered on the site: the section heading then three quoted phrases, no outer tiles, no mode labels, no eyebrows |
| The reflection action plan page is gone from both surfaces | one removal in api/_lib/results-sections.js took it out of the nav on both; 29 sections render clean |
| The site's at-a-glance action plan is what each of you wrote | it was a derived list; it is now the answer to "one thing I want to work on", the same question the app uses |
| The expectations tip tiles read "A tip for [name] and [name]" on both | one string in `PAGE_COPY`, sent on the payload and passed into the page |
| No results page anywhere carries a page dot and eyebrow | the last two were reflection pages; `check-page-eyebrows.mjs` was blind to them because the name came through a constant, and now matches the shape as well. Planted both ways |
| The four at-a-glance titles you named are the same on both surfaces | `PAGE_TITLES` in api/_lib/results-sections.js, sent on the results payload; neither surface writes a page heading of its own for these four |
| "Where you each land" is "Communication style overview" on both | `PAGE_COPY.commPlacements`, read by both |
| The reflection ratings page is "How you each view the relationship" | one string in api/_lib/reflection-results.js, which both surfaces already read |
| The storycard rule is the same orange-to-indigo gradient on both | it was solid orange in the app; the gradient and its size come from the payload now |
| The mark sits beside the wordmark on both | the app had the word alone; it uses the PNG the rest of the app already ships |
| Both surfaces draw each person in the same colour | the partner dot was a lighter blue in the app; `PERSON_COLORS` is shared and both read it |
| No endpoint answers 500 to a body it should refuse | `check-body-parsing.mjs`, 343 calls across 53 endpoints, planted three ways |
| Unmatched URLs answer a real 404 on the live site | checked from outside: /gift-cards, /lmft-booking and a nonsense path all 404, the real pages still 200 |
| The 404 page renders and offers six ways back | loaded it in a browser on the live site |
| Every one of the nine storycards is sized from the shared scale on both surfaces | `check-storycard-type.mjs`: 30 roles, no type written anywhere in the website's card region, and no role either surface leaves undrawn |
| Converting the website changed nothing on screen | 135 text nodes captured from all ten cards in a browser before and after, identical three times |
| The couple type page is titled "[name] and [name]'s unique relationship dynamic" | your wording, in `PAGE_COPY.coupleTypeTitle`, read by both surfaces |
| The placement dots on the overview pages are bigger | 10px to 13px in the app, which is the size the site draws |
| The dividing line is back under the expectations page heading in the app | it stayed on the site throughout |
| The expectations intro tile has room above it | a full step of spacing between the page title and the tile |
| Tapping Insights while already on Insights returns to Highlights | iOS reports a repeat tap as an ordinary tab selection, so what separates the two is whether the screen was focused when the press arrived |
| The reading time reads "6 min read", in orange | in the article row and at the top of the article |
| The "Swipe >" label is gone and the fade carries it | `EdgeFadedRow` draws each fade only when there is something past that edge, which covers the results nav too |
| In Practice articles are read in the app | all twelve were pages on the website that the app handed to the browser. Their bodies are generated from those pages into `api/_in-practice-bodies.js`; `check-in-practice-bodies.mjs` proves every word of every article reaches the app and nothing else does, planted three ways |
| The tag list starts empty, with an add field and five suggestions | opening Notes used to write twenty-one tags into the account. It writes nothing now, and the names an annotation is read through are sent as reference data instead, derived from the live lists on every request. `check-no-seeded-tags.mjs` runs the endpoint and proves all three, planted three ways |
| Every results page is the same colour on both surfaces | it was not: the website paints Communication purple into the brand orange and the app painted it in Conflict's blue, because six page gradients were typed on both surfaces and five pairs happened to agree. One copy now, in `api/_lib/section-grounds.js`; `check-section-grounds.mjs`, planted four ways |
| Physical Intimacy's Conversations page is cream, as it is on the site | it was in the section's dark gradient, which the site keeps for at a glance and the dimension pages |
| A repeat tap on Insights cannot silently stop working | the handle it goes through is cleared only by the screen that set it; two screens overlapping for a moment would have left it null for the rest of the session |
| Every results at a glance page is a rounded tile, detail pages are full width | your call, and my view is that it is the right one: a tile has edges, and edges claim that what is inside is the whole of something, which is true of an overview and false of a three-screen scroll. One component, `glance-tile.tsx`, so the five cannot drift |
| Relationship Reflection looks like the site, page for page | the at-a-glance heading and its line were built inside src/App.jsx and are now built once for both; the two detail pages were dark in the app and light on the site, and are light; What you each admire moved to the page the site puts it on; the ranking shows every item |
| Conflict's at a glance page is in the same tile | the detail pages already matched, bar a white card wrapped round two cream quote cards |
| Unmatched URLs answer 404 rather than 200 with an empty shell | the catch-all is gone from `vercel.json`; `check-route-targets.mjs` fails if it or anything as wide comes back, planted twice |
| The app and the website size a storycard from the same numbers | `check-storycard-type.mjs`, 17 roles, planted seven ways |
| The app home tile draws its icons in orange | one line, and a disabled row keeps the muted brown |
| The workbook download link is never handed over expired | `check-workbook-link.mjs`, 9 link shapes, planted four ways; the stored link was signed for 7 days and served forever |
| Every table in the schema has row level security | `check-rls-policies.mjs`, both halves, planted six ways in total |
| One six-month check-in email, the cron one | the browser-triggered copy is gone from the sender, the app and the trigger record; `check-email-preview.mjs` shows 13 emails, all triggered |
| No surviving RLS policy lets a stranger read personal data | `check-rls-policies.mjs`, replayed in migration order, planted four ways |
| Both workbook variants render, same type and different types | `check-workbook-renders.mjs`, planted three ways; the same-type one had been broken since this morning |
| All 27 review-document generators build | `check-doc-generators.mjs`, now part of `npm run check`; seven were reading constants out of src/App.jsx that had moved into modules |
| The reflection review shows its keyword lists, and says when one is gone | the names are read from the module rather than typed, so a missing list prints as missing instead of empty |
| The five emails nothing sends are gone | `check-email-preview.mjs`: 14 emails, every one with a trigger |
| The gift cards are retired | the designer, both card templates, the print sheet, the generator, the card endpoint, the claim endpoint and the claim path through signup. All five signup screens render character for character as before |
| A rejected database query is reported rather than drawn as a zero | `check-query-failures.mjs`, planted four ways; this is why the Engagement page read empty |
| Every tile on the Engagement page has its own slicer | 12 of them, rendered in a browser; payloads cached per cut |
| The visit numbers say they are visits, not unique visitors | on the headline tile and on the chart beside it |
| One set of package prices everywhere | `check-package-prices.mjs`, 9 tables, planted four ways; the tax endpoint was quoting premium at $295 against a $198 charge |
| The admin no longer prices anniversary at 159 or premium at 299 | corrected to the catalogue, and the gate above holds it there |
| Every email the product sends is rendered by the code that sends it, on one page | `check-email-preview.mjs`, 19 emails, planted four ways |
| The preview page holds no email copy of its own | same gate: an object with a subject and a body in that file fails the build |
| The record of which emails are actually triggered is current | `build-email-triggers.mjs` generates it, `check-email-triggers.mjs` fails if it drifts |
| Every scheduled email carries an unsubscribe link with the recipient's own id | `check-unsubscribe.mjs`, now rendered end to end from a profile row rather than read statically |
| The ten endpoint emails and the four order cases are unchanged by the refactor | snapshotted before and after, byte for byte identical |
| Every route in vercel.json lands on a file that exists | `check-route-targets.mjs`, 80 routes, planted four ways |
| Two routes pointing at files deleted in 97cacb6 are gone from vercel.json | `check-route-targets.mjs`; note /lmft-booking still answers 200 with the app shell, because the catch-all takes anything left, which is O5 and yours |
| Clicking Reviews lands on the reviews, not the top of the FAQ | faq.html scrolls to the section it already had an id for |
| Nothing in the tree names a domain that is not ours | `check-site-origin.mjs`, 383 files, planted four ways |
| The cart can price a workbook add-on again | in a browser: threw ReferenceError before, returns 108 after, which is the 89 package plus the 19 digital workbook |
| The combined CSV export can build a row | `s` was an undeclared name in four lines of it; `check-server-undefined.mjs` |
| An order arriving without line items still sends its receipt and setup link | three add-on flags were read and never passed; `check-server-undefined.mjs` |
| A login with a partner email in the form completes | it built the invite URL from an undeclared name and threw before the spinner stopped; `check-server-undefined.mjs` |
| No file under api/, public/ or src/ reads a name nothing declares | `check-server-undefined.mjs`, 139 files, planted six ways |
| Neither open write endpoint stores a row for an empty POST | `check-open-writes.mjs`, 14 bodies, and it counts outbound calls so a guard below the write is caught |
| The Engagement page is the layout you asked for: headline tiles, funnel and acquisition, five time charts, two Learning tables, two notes charts | rendered in Chrome: 9 canvases, 2 tables, 5 slicers, no console errors |
| Every view on the page reads one slicer, the same one the rest of the admin uses | the slice is applied server-side in `api/admin-engagement.js` before anything aggregates |
| No tile on the page draws a chart without first checking the measure was collected, and every gap says why | `check-engagement-honesty.mjs`, planted against three ways and caught all three |
| App time and site time can be told apart | `surface` on every event, sent by `public/_track.js` as `site` and by the app client as `app` |
| Results time is filed per section on both surfaces | `app:results:<section>` from the website, `useScreenTime(results:<id>)` from the app |
| Privacy policy, terms, data policy and EULA exist and are linked from every footer | `check-internal-links.mjs`, 908 links |
| "Your privacy choices" exists and Global Privacy Control is read server-side | `Sec-GPC` in `api/privacy-choices.js`; `check-consent-gate.mjs` |
| The privacy notice reaches every customer-facing page | `check-notice-reach.mjs`, 34 pages |
| Sign-in survives a tab switch, a locked keychain and an empty token | `check-session-recovery.mjs` |

| # | Task | Verified by |

| — | Analytics tiles drew empty charts instead of saying they were empty | One change in `mkChart`, so it covers every chart on every tab |

## How this is kept

**An approved table comes out.** Ellie: "When I have approved a review point
for which you built a review table below sec3, please remove the associated
table as I have already reviewed it." A table that has done its job costs
review attention on the wrong half of the document, which is the failure the
tables exist to prevent. The builders are in git history, so the next one is a
few lines rather than a rewrite.

1. A list arrives. This file is updated first, before any work.
2. Work happens.
3. This file is updated again, then handed back for review.
4. A general ask ("remove all X") gets a search across both surfaces and a
   gate, not the edits the message happened to name.
5. Every content change to one surface is mirrored on the other (msg 79).
6. Anything blocked on Ellie goes in section 1, whatever kind of thing it is.
   A migration is not a review item: until it runs, a column is missing and a
   chart is empty. Three of them sat in section 3 reading as optional.

---

## The old section 3

Every individual ask from the first 135 messages, 184 of them, lived here as
its own row. They are all either verified above, folded into a review item, or
long since shipped and superseded. The full list is in git:

    git show 75e002c:TASKS.md

Nothing was thrown away. It was too long to read, which made it useless as a
list of what to do next, which is the only thing a task file is for.
